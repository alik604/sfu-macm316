## Values of $N$ and $N_{ex}$
I knew that I was eventually going to take $log_{10}(N)$ to explore a potential power-law relationship between matrices of size $N$ and flop counts involved in GE, so I chose to define $N = 10^{k}$, where $k = 1, 2, 3, 4$, to correspond nicely with $log_{10}$ values. I chose not to include $N = 10^{0}$, since this is a trivial $1 \times 1$ matrix, which takes no operations to solve.
