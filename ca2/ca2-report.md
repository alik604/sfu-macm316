## Values of $N$ and $N_{ex}$
I knew that I was eventually going to take $log_{10}(N)$ and $log_{10}(\text{avg time to solve mtx})$, so I chose to define $N = \lceil 10^{k} \rceil$, where $k = 1, 1.5 2, 2.5 3$, to correspond nicely with $log_{10}$ values.  

I started by defining $\texttt{dense\_Nex}$, $\texttt{tri\_Nex}$, and $\texttt{perm\_Nex}$ to be the number of solves for each type of matrix $[M_{d}], [M_{t}]$, and $[M_{p}]$, respectively. After some fiddling around, I managed to find values for each $\texttt{*\_Nex}$ that would automatically scale well as $N$ increased each loop.

## Conclusions
It seems like using *backslash* in MATLAB somehow cuts down on the computational cost as $N$ increases. Theoretically, the number of flops in solving $[M_{d}]$ should increase by $O(N^3)$, giving the log-log plot a slope of 3. However, the computations have shown the slope to be $\approx 1.8$ (Figure 1), which is jarring. Perhaps, since we don't generate a new random matrix for each solve, MATLAB caches the LU factorization of the Matrix somehow?

Interestingly, the slope in the log-log plot of the permuted upper triangular matrix $[M_{p}]$ is greater than that of the dense matrix $[M_{d}]$. MATLAB seems to treat them both similarly, but solving $[M_{p}]$ takes longer for some reason. I take this to mean that MATLAB doesn't recognize the matrix as being a permuted upper triangular matrix, and tries to solve it as a dense matrix: as MATLAB goes about row reduction, it often encounters situations where row interchanges are necessary, unlike in the dense matrix case.

$[M_{3}]$ still requires some row reduction, whereas $[M_{t}]$ requires only back-subsitution. This bit of reduction is still enough to put tridiagonal matrices behind upper triangular matrices, and the time it takes to solve $[M_{3}]$ is somewhere between the time it takes to solve a dense matrix and an upper triangular matrix. Out of these matrices, $[M_{3s}]$ is the fastest type of matrix to solve: its slope is $\approx 0.87$, making it even faster than $O(n)$.
