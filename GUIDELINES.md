# guidelines for computing assignments
The computing assignments are designed to get you to think critically about numerical algorithms.  MACM 316 is not a programming class.  Hence assignments will concentrate on the quantitative and qualitative understanding of algorithms, especially with respect to the three key concepts in the course: **accuracy**, **efficiency** and **robustness**.

Your reports should not only explain **what** code you have run, but also demonstrate your understanding of **why** it was useful to run.  That is, state what you have observed and what it tells you about the algorithm under consideration.   In your report, it is important to both explain **and** justify what you did, the parameters you chose, etc.

## General Rules

You are encouraged to discuss the problems with others, but the submission __**must** be your own work.__ You must acknowledge all collaborations and contributions from the instructor, TAs, fellow students, Canvas discussions, etc.

## Written Communication

The purpose of written work is to communicate ideas to the reader.  The quality of this communication reflects your level of understanding of the assignments.  Consider your fellow students as your target audience -- this is the level at which graders will be evaluating your work.

When writing your assignments, focus on **clarity**, **conciseness** and **correctness**:

* **Clarity:**  Organize your assignment around key ideas, produce clearly labelled tables, plots and graphics and explain the information shown in them.

* **Conciseness**:  Your assignments are limited to one page, including all tables, plots and graphics.  Streamline your presentations whilst getting the main ideas across.  Avoid being overly verbose.

* **Correctness**: Check your work carefully for mistakes.  Does your data make intuitive sense?  Surprising results may suggest a bug in your code.  Are the conclusions you draw logical?  If in doubt, discuss the problem with others.
